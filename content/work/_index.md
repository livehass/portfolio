Experience in a Junior Fullstack Java Bootcamp, learning technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, React, Tailwind, Maven, MySQL, HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Javascript, and Typescript. I have front-end experience developing projects using Node.js and Javascript, with technologies like Git, GitHub, HTML5, and CSS3.

Currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development, which has provided me with problem-solving skills, teamwork, and knowledge of relevant software technologies. I have a background in sales and excellent communication skills. I am transitioning my career into the technology field. Thank you for your attention, and I am available if needed.
