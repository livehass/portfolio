This project provides a simple CRUD list of patients and computes the Body Mass Index (IMC/BMI) from user-provided weight and height. It demonstrates DOM manipulation, form validation, and dynamic table updates without any front-end framework.

## Highlights

- Add and remove patients from the UI list.
- Live BMI calculation with validation for realistic weight/height ranges.
- Lightweight, framework-free codebase ideal for learning DOM APIs.
