Server-side implementation for an e-commerce platform. The project focuses on RESTful API endpoints, entity modeling, and typical e-commerce flows (products, carts, orders). Build and dependency management is handled with Maven.

## Notes

- Look for controllers under `src/main/java/.../controller` and domain entities under `src/main/java/.../model`.
- Tests (if present) follow standard Maven layout and can be run with `mvn test`.
