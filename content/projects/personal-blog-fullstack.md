A fullstack personal blog application developed during a fullstack bootcamp. The project demonstrates integration between a Spring Boot back-end and a React/TypeScript front-end, with features such as user-authored posts, routing, and client/server validation.

## Highlights

- Full RESTful API implemented in Spring Boot.
- React + TypeScript front-end with client-side routing and reusable components.
- Build automation with Maven and typical dev/test scripts.
