A compact and practical travel checklist designed to help travelers plan and store their packing lists locally. The app demonstrates a small, maintainable architecture: a clear separation between UI rendering, data persistence (via `localStorage`), and JSON-driven list management.

## Key Features

- Persistent checklist using `localStorage` so lists survive page reloads.
- JSON-based data model for easy import/export and programmatic manipulation.
- Responsive UI built with semantic HTML and CSS for quick customization.

## Notes for maintainers

Keep UI logic small and modular. The data layer uses a simple JSON schema (array of items with id, label, checked) â€” tests and migrations should operate on that shape.
